title: "Bound-Preserving Higher Order Methods for Infiltration"
share: false
---

We are developing a new class of fintie element methods for infiltration that extend recent advancements in bound-preserving and higher-order methods for hyperbolic and degenerate parabolic equations. This work aims to make physics-based modeling of infiltration and subsurface flow fast, accurate, and reliable.
