I am an associate professort at Louisisiana State University
in the [Department of Civil and Environmental
Engineering](https://cee.lsu.edu). I have been conducting research
in numerical methods, mathematical modeling, and computational
engineering for over twenty-five years.

I joined LSU in August, 2020, where I am the [CSRS Distinguished
Professor in Coastal
Engineering](https://www.lsu.edu/eng/cee/people/kees.php) and hold a
joint position in the [Center for Computation and
Technology](https://cct.lsu.edu). I am also a fellow of the [Coastal
Studies Institute](https://www.lsu.edu/csi) and member-at-large on the

Summa Cum Laude from Millsaps College with a BS in Mathematics and
Honors in European Studies before attending graduate school at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I received an MS
in Mathematics and Ph.D. in Environmental Science and
Engineering. After completing a post-doc in the Center for Research in
Scientific Computaitona at North Carolina State University, I spent
