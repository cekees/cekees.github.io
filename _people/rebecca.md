I am a graduate student in Civil and Environmental Engineering working toward a Masterâ€™s degree in the Coastal and Ecological Engineering program. My work involves computational modeling of water waves and overland flow. 

I grew up in Philadelphia, PA, and spent my summers in Wildwood, NJ and graduated from North Penn High School in 2017. I went to the University of Delaware where I received my Bachelor of Environmental Engineering with a minor in Civil Engineering in May 2021. I did research under various Coastal Engineering professors at UD and an internship at the Cape May Whale Watch and Research Center before starting at LSU in August 2021.
