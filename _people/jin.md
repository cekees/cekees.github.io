I am a research scientist working on computational (hydrodynamic and morphological) models of coastal processes ʕ •ᴥ•ʔ.\
Also, I have research experience in laboratory and field experiments on sediment dynamics.\
My recent interest is to better understand coastal dynamics on the coastal-land margins in response to climate drivers (e.g., climate change and sea-level rise).
