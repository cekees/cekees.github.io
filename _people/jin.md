<p style="font-family:arial">I am a research scientist working on computational (hydrodynamic and morphological) models of coastal processes ʕ •ᴥ•ʔ. </p>
<p style="font-family:arial">Also, I have research experience in laboratory and field experiments on sediment dynamics. </p>
<p style="font-family:arial">My recent interest is to better understand coastal dynamics on the coastal-land margins in response to climate drivers (e.g., climate change and sea-level rise). </p>
