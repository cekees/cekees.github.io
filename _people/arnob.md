I am a Graduate student at Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering in Louisiana State University-Baton Rouge. My thesis work is related to Groundwater infiltration using the Finite element approach.

I have several years of working experience at the Institute of Water Modelling (IWM). During my service period, I have been involved in different projects related to Groundwater and Surface water hydrology. In these projects, I have been involved in hydrological data collection and processing. I have completed my undergraduate in civil engineering at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). 

My goal is to acquire skills in the field of Hydrology and Finite elements and make contributions to this field.
