I have committed myself to research, teaching, and service. My ultimate goal is to link all experts and researchers with interdisciplinary backgrounds at all kinds of levels to create a positive impact on the world.

I was born in Taipei, Taiwan. I graduated from National Taiwan University with a BS and PhD in Civil Engineering. After completing a post-doc at NTU for one and half years, I visited the Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering at UT Austin for two years. Then I joined LSU in July 2021.
