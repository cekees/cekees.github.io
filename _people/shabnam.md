I am a Research Assistant at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Louisiana State University.  My research at LSU involves the evolution of natural riverine and coastal plan forms. Relevant topics include Bio-Geomorphodynamics, computational modeling of water waves, bank erosion, and vegetative modulation processes.

I was born in Iran. I graduated from Tarbiat Modares University with a Ph.D. in water resource management studying flow structure around vegetation patches using the PIV system. I visited Ocean Graduate School at the University of Western Australia for 6 months in 2019.

My ultimate goal is to be an international researcher in the field and use my knowledge to produce outstanding research outputs.
