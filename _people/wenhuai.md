I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Louisiana State University. My research at LSU is focused on developing a better understanding of the interaction between fluids and structures to resolve critical issues related to life safety, human welfare, and ecosystem protection. Relevant topics include structural control of civil infrastructures, high-fidelity numerical tools for computational modeling of water waves, and offshore & marine technology.

<p style="font-family:arial">
I have committed myself to research, teaching, and service. My ultimate goal is to link all experts and researchers with interdisciplinary backgrounds at all kinds of levels to create a positive impact on the world.

I was born in Taipei, Taiwan. I graduated from National Taiwan University with a BS and PhD in Civil Engineering. After completing a post-doc at NTU for one and half years, I visited the Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering at UT Austin for two years. Then I joined LSU in July 2021.
