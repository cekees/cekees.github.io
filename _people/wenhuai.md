I am an IT Consultant in the Coastal Ecosystem Design Studio at Louisiana State University. My research at LSU is focused on developing a better understanding of the interaction between fluids and structures to resolve critical issues related to life safety, human welfare, and ecosystem protection. Relevant topics include natural-based facilities for coastal protection, structural vibration control technologies for offshore & marine structures, and high-performance numerical methods for wave-structure modeling.

<p style="font-family:arial">
I have committed myself to research, teaching, and service. My ultimate goal is to link all experts and researchers with interdisciplinary backgrounds at all kinds of levels to create a positive impact on the world.

I was born in Taipei, Taiwan. I graduated from National Taiwan University with a BS and PhD in Civil Engineering. After completing a post-doc at NTU for one and half years, I visited the Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering at UT Austin for two years. Then I joined LSU in July 2021.
