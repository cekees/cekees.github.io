I am a graduate student in Civil and Environmental Engineering working towards a master’s degree in Coastal and Ecological Engineering.
My current work involves computational and physical modeling of coastal hydro- and morphodynamic processes.
As a Delaware native, I spent my summers as an ocean lifeguard in Bethany Beach, DE, where I came to love the coast. After graduating from Sussex Central High School in 2019, I attended the University of Delaware where I received my bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering. While at Delaware, I spent time as an undergraduate researcher with the UD Center for Applied Coastal Research.
